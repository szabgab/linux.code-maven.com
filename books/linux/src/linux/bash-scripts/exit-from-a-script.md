# Exit from a script

* exit
* $?


Calling exit  will stop the running of the script and set the exit status to 0. Calling exit N with any number of N
will set the exit status to that N.

```
exit   - on the command line to close the window (or the most recent shell)
exit   - in a script to end the script (exit code = most recent statement)
exit n - exit code n
```
